# Solidity Web3 Project - Decentralized Voting System

Welcome to the Solidity Web3 repository! This project serves as a foundational resource for learning and developing decentralized applications (DApps) using Solidity and Web3.js.

## Decentralized Voting System
This project implements a **Decentralized Voting System** with the following features:

- **Admin registers candidates**: Only an authorized admin can add candidates to the election.
- **Voters can cast their votes**: Registered voters can vote for their preferred candidate.
- **One vote per voter**: The smart contract ensures that each voter can only vote once.
- **Transparency & accessibility**: The voting process is transparent, and results can be retrieved at any time.

## Project Overview
This repository provides smart contracts written in Solidity along with Web3.js integration for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. It covers essential blockchain development concepts, including:

- Writing and deploying smart contracts
- Connecting a frontend with Web3.js
- Handling Ethereum transactions
- Interacting with smart contracts using JavaScript
- Demonstrating interaction with the same contract on the Ethereum blockchain using Web3.js
